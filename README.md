# Description

Git 'Em All is a Pokemon battle game where the player navigates a puzzle overworld and battles Team Rocket trainers to reach and defeat the final boss, Giovanni.

# How to Play

+ Move around the Overworld with the Arrow keys or WASD. Try to reach Giovanni, the boss under the large tree in the top left corner.

+ Enemy Team Rocket trainers will challenge you to battle if they see you. You will then enter the Battle screen.

+ In the Battle screen, press Spacebar or click the text or PokeBall icon to continue through dialogue.
    + Choose which ability to attack with each turn. Different colored abilities are more or less effective against different kinds of enemy Pokemon.
    + For example, green buttons are Grass attacks and purple buttons are Poison attacks.
    + Attacks deal damage to a Pokemon's health (HP). Once a Pokemon reaches 0 HP, that Pokemon faints and the trainer's next Pokemon will come out.
    + Once all of a trainer's Pokemon have fainted that trainer is defeated. Make sure it's the enemy and not you!
    + After defeating an enemy Team Rocket trainer, you can walk freely past them without having to battle them again.

+ Your Pokemon do not heal between battles so you need to be careful in conserving their strength if you want to be able to defeat Giovanni at the end.
